# resd.dpdk_tcp Stage 1 — Phase Roadmap

**What this document is:** A living roadmap for Stage 1 implementation, decomposed into sequential phases. Each phase produces testable software and ships independently. Each phase gets its own plan file (`YYYY-MM-DD-stage1-phase-aN-<slug>.md`) with bite-sized tasks.

**How to use it:** Before starting a phase session, read this roadmap to get cold-start context, then read the per-phase plan file for task-level detail. After a phase ships, update the "Status" column and drop a link to the next plan file.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-dpdk-tcp-design.md`

## A1 — Workspace skeleton + DPDK init + empty engine

**Goal:** Bring repo from empty to a compiling Rust workspace + C++ consumer that creates an Engine, brings up DPDK EAL and NIC queues, allocates mempools, calibrates TSC, runs a `poll_once` that rx-bursts and drops everything.

**Spec refs:** §2, §2.2, §4 (lifecycle subset), §7.1, §7.5, §9.1.

**Deliverables:**
- Cargo workspace with `resd-net-sys` (DPDK FFI), `resd-net-core` (internals), `resd-net` (public C ABI).
- `include/resd_net.h` auto-generated via cbindgen.
- C++ consumer sample that creates + destroys an engine.
- CI: build + unit tests + header drift + C++ build + clippy + rustfmt.
- Integration test proving lifecycle over DPDK TAP.

**Does NOT include:** packet parsing, ARP, ICMP, TCP, connect, send, recv events, timers beyond `now_ns`, real mempool exhaustion paths.

**Dependencies:** none.

**Rough scale:** 14 tasks.

---

## A2 — L2/L3 + static ARP + ICMP-in (PMTUD)

**Goal:** Stack decodes incoming Ethernet + IPv4 packets from the RX burst. Non-TCP drops with counter. ARP/gateway-MAC resolved at engine setup via netlink helper. ICMP frag-needed updates PMTU; other ICMP dropped silently.

**Spec refs:** §5.1 (RX up through ip_decode), §6.3 RFC matrix rows for 791/792/1122/1191, §8 (ARP bullet).

**Deliverables:**
- `l2.rs` decodes Ethernet headers; verifies dst MAC equals our MAC; drops broadcast/multicast except ARP reply for gateway.
- `l3_ip.rs` decodes IPv4; verifies checksum (or trusts NIC flag); drops non-TCP/ICMP.
- `arp.rs` holds a static gateway-MAC table, populated via a one-shot netlink lookup at `engine_create`; gratuitous-ARP refresh timer every N seconds.
- ICMP frag-needed is parsed and its inner MTU value updates a PMTU state (per-peer IP).
- Counters in the `ip` group wired.
- Integration test that sends crafted Ethernet frames through a TAP pair and asserts counters.

**Does NOT include:** TCP input (routes to a stub `tcp_input` that just increments a counter), egress IP path (that's part of A3), DNS.

**Dependencies:** A1.

**Rough scale:** ~15 tasks.

---

## A3 — TCP handshake + basic data transfer

**Goal:** `resd_net_connect` to a remote peer, complete the SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK handshake, send and receive bytes, clean close (FIN/FIN-ACK). No TCP options beyond MSS yet, no reassembly, no SACK, no RACK, no retransmit.

**Spec refs:** §4 (`resd_net_connect`, `resd_net_send`, `RESD_NET_EVT_CONNECTED`, `RESD_NET_EVT_READABLE`, `RESD_NET_EVT_CLOSED`), §5.2 TX call chain, §6.1 FSM, §6.2 `TcpConn` struct (minimum fields for basic ops), §6.5 ISS (stub first — A5 finalizes).

**Deliverables:**
- `tcp/conn.rs` — `TcpConn` struct, minimum fields (sequence space, state, recv_queue, snd_retrans).
- `tcp/fsm.rs` — state machine for client side: CLOSED → SYN_SENT → ESTABLISHED → FIN_WAIT_1 → ... → CLOSED.
- `tcp/input.rs` — basic segment processing: SYN-ACK handling, ACK handling, data ingress → `recv_queue`.
- `tcp/output.rs` — SYN emission, ACK emission, data segmentation (MSS-sized chunks).
- Flow table (`flow_table.rs`) — 4-tuple hash lookup with a small pre-warmed array.
- `engine.rs` wires the TCP path into the poll loop; emits `RESD_NET_EVT_CONNECTED`, `RESD_NET_EVT_READABLE`, `RESD_NET_EVT_CLOSED`.
- `resd_net_connect` / `resd_net_send` / `resd_net_close` extern "C" functions implemented end-to-end.
- Integration test: connect to a netcat listener over a TAP pair, send + receive known bytes, close cleanly.

**Does NOT include:** TCP options beyond MSS, PAWS, SACK, retransmit, out-of-order reassembly, `WRITABLE` event (punt to A6), `FORCE_TW_SKIP`, TIME_WAIT short-circuit.

**Dependencies:** A1, A2.

**Rough scale:** ~25 tasks.

---

## A4 — TCP options + PAWS + reassembly + SACK scoreboard

**Goal:** Negotiate TCP options at handshake (window scale, timestamps, SACK-permitted, MSS). Honor PAWS (RFC 7323) to drop old-incarnation segments. Reassemble out-of-order segments via linked-mbuf-chain hole-filling. Track SACK blocks (RFC 2018) for the send side.

**Spec refs:** §6.2 (`ws_shift_*`, `ts_enabled`, `sack_enabled`), §6.3 matrix rows for 7323/2018/6691, §7.2 `recv_reorder`.

**Deliverables:**
- `tcp/options.rs` — TCP options encode/decode for MSS, WS, SACK-permitted, Timestamps.
- Handshake wires up negotiated options on both sides.
- `tcp/sack.rs` — SACK scoreboard struct + update rules.
- `tcp/reassembly.rs` — out-of-order segment list, merges into `recv_queue` as gaps close.
- PAWS check on input; stale segments dropped with counter.
- Segments emitted include TSecr + TSval; scaled windows in TCP header.
- Integration tests: out-of-order delivery, SACK-block encoding/decoding, PAWS rejection of replayed segment.

- **Counter additions (all slow-path per spec §9.1.1 — fire only on error / rare lifecycle / pathological paths; no measurable hot-path impact):**

  A4-scope counters (PAWS, options, reassembly, SACK — fire on their feature's specific paths):
  - `rx_paws_rejected` — PAWS check dropped a stale-timestamp segment (RFC 7323).
  - `rx_bad_option` — malformed TCP option on input (option decoder rejected).
  - `rx_reassembly_queued` — OOO segment placed on the reassembly list (fires only on reorder / loss).
  - `rx_reassembly_hole_filled` — gap closed, in-order data merged into recv queue.
  - `tx_sack_blocks` — SACK blocks encoded in an outbound ACK (fires only when we have recv-side gaps).
  - `rx_sack_blocks` — SACK blocks decoded from a peer ACK (fires only on peer-side loss).

  Cross-phase slow-path additions that fit naturally in A4's increment-site scope (backfill what A3 didn't cover + things A4's new paths pass through anyway):
  - `rx_bad_seq` — segment with seq outside `rcv_wnd`; silently dropped prior to this counter.
  - `rx_bad_ack` — ACK acking nothing new or acking future data; previously silent.
  - `rx_dup_ack` — duplicate ACK (baseline for A5 fast-retransmit consumer).
  - `rx_zero_window` — peer advertised `rwnd=0`; critical trading signal ("the exchange is slow").
  - `rx_urgent_dropped` — URG flag segment; Stage 1 doesn't support URG, dropped.
  - `tx_zero_window` — we advertised `rwnd=0` (our recv buffer full).
  - `tx_window_update` — we emitted a pure window-update segment.
  - `conn_time_wait_reaped` — TIME_WAIT deadline expired, connection reclaimed (A3's reaper has no counter).
  - `conn_table_full` — `resd_net_connect` rejected because flow table at `max_connections`.

  Explicitly **not** in A4 scope (owned by later phases — included here only as a note so nobody re-proposes them as A4 work):
  - `events_dropped_queue_full` / `events_error_enomem` / `events_error_eperm_tw_required` — per-engine event FIFO + `RESD_NET_EVT_ERROR` emissions (**A6**: depends on A6's real event-queue overflow semantics, `ENOMEM` mempool-exhaustion path, `FORCE_TW_SKIP` + RFC 6191 guard).
  - `conn_timeout_syn_sent` — SYN_SENT timeout (**A5**: depends on A5's real RTO timer + `connect_timeout_ms` enforcement).

  All of the above A4-scope increments live in existing slow-path sites (error branches, rare-event handlers, per-connection lifecycle). None are on the per-segment or per-poll hot path. A8 counter-coverage audit adds scenarios for each so zero fields stay unreachable.

- **Hot-path counters — compile-time gated per spec §9.1.1** (fields always allocated in the struct for C-ABI stability; `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` applies to the increment sites only):

  - `tcp.tx_payload_bytes` / `tcp.rx_payload_bytes` — gated by cargo feature `obs-byte-counters`, **default OFF**.
    - *Answers*: "how many TCP payload bytes did this engine move?" without the L2/L3 overhead baked into `eth.tx_bytes` / `rx_bytes`. Trading use case: separating market-data bytes consumed from order bytes emitted.
    - *Not derivable* from existing counters — `tx_data × MSS` is a guess since segments may carry less than MSS.
    - *Increment pattern*: per-burst, never per-segment. Stack-local `u64` accumulator inside the TX-burst loop / RX poll loop, single `add(&counter, burst_bytes)` after the burst drains. Doc the pattern at the increment site; reviewers reject per-segment variants.
    - *Turn on* with `--features obs-byte-counters` at build time.

  - `poll.iters_with_rx_burst_max` — gated by cargo feature `obs-poll-saturation`, **default ON** (listed in `[features] default`).
    - *Answers*: "is RX falling behind?" — increments on every poll iteration where `rx_burst` returned `max_burst` elements, meaning the NIC probably had more packets queued than we pulled. No other counter surfaces this.
    - *Not derivable* from `iters_with_rx` + `rx_pkts` — those give average burst size, not saturation frequency.
    - *Increment pattern*: single `if burst_size == max_burst { inc(counter); }` already inside the existing `iters_with_rx` branch. One extra comparison + conditional `fetch_add` per poll.
    - *Turn off* with `cargo build --no-default-features` (plus re-listing any other default features you want to keep) for absolute-minimum-overhead builds.

  Both flags live in `crates/resd-net-core/Cargo.toml` under `[features]`. The C header (`include/resd_net.h`) is regenerated without `#[cfg]` gating on the struct itself, so `resd_net_counters_t` layout is stable across feature sets — feature-off builds just leave the corresponding fields at zero. `docs/user-guide/04-configuration.md` (A12) documents the flags and their trade-offs; `docs/maintainer-guide/14-coding-conventions.md` enforces the inline-justification rule for any future hot-path counter additions.

**Does NOT include:** retransmit (A5), RACK, congestion control. Checksum-path split counters (`tx_csum_offload_used` / `_soft`) intentionally **not** added — one-shot startup log of the negotiated csum path is sufficient; runtime counters aren't worth the per-segment cost given offload state doesn't hot-swap.

**Dependencies:** A3.

**Rough scale:** ~25 tasks (+2 for the hot-path counters: feature-flag wiring + batched-increment sites; +3 for the slow-path counter batch: struct extension + layout assertion, slow-path increment sites, A8-audit scenario entries).

---

## A5 — RACK-TLP + RTO + retransmit + ISS

**Goal:** Loss detection via RACK-TLP (RFC 8985) as primary path; RFC 6298 RTO computation + retransmit timer; final RFC 6528 ISS recipe; RTO-driven retransmit with fresh-header-mbuf policy (no in-place edit).

**Spec refs:** §6.3 matrix rows for 6298/8985/6528, §6.5 (ISS formula, retransmit mbuf policy, lazy RTO re-arm), §7.4 (timer wheel for RTO/TLP scheduling).

**Deliverables:**
- `tcp/rack.rs` — RACK state + reorder-detection.
- `tcp/rto.rs` — SRTT/RTTVAR/RTO computation per RFC 6298; minRTO configurable.
- `tcp/iss.rs` — full SipHash-based ISS with boot_nonce + monotonic clock.
- Retransmit path: allocates fresh header mbuf from `tx_hdr_mempool`, chains to original data mbuf, never edits original in place.
- Lazy RTO timer re-arm (no remove+insert on every ACK).
- `RESD_NET_EVT_TCP_RETRANS` / `RESD_NET_EVT_TCP_LOSS_DETECTED` events emitted (gated by `tcp_per_packet_events`).
- Integration tests: loss-induced retransmit, RACK reorder detection, TLP probe firing, ISS monotonicity across reconnects.

**Does NOT include:** congestion control (off by default; Reno arrives in a dedicated follow-up if needed), ECN (separate flag, no delivery in Stage 1 gates).

**Dependencies:** A4.

**Rough scale:** ~20 tasks.

## A5.5 — Event-log forensics + in-flight introspection + TLP tuning

**Numbering note:** Inserted after A5 as a focused forensics + order-entry-latency pack. Uses the decimal "A5.5" tag because the scope is genuinely downstream of A5 (extends A5's event producers, TLP module, and connect opts) and independent of both A-HW (no offload overlap) and A6 (no timer / flush / WRITABLE overlap). Can run serially after A5 or in parallel with A-HW.

**Scope widening note:** A5.5 started as observability-only; the TLP tuning knobs added after review are genuine wire-behavior changes. They're per-connection opt-in with defaults that preserve A5's RFC 8985 behavior exactly, so the phase still has zero impact on existing callers — but the §6.3/§6.4 RFC matrix needs new rows for the opt-in modes.

**Goal:** Close four gaps identified during A5 design review: (1) `enqueued_ts_ns` is currently sampled at poll-drain time rather than event-emission time (±poll-interval skew); (2) event queue is unbounded with no overflow visibility; (3) send-path state (`snd_una`/`snd_nxt`/`snd_wnd`/buffer pending+free) and RTT estimator state (`srtt_us`/`rttvar_us`/`min_rtt_us`/`rto_us`) are not readable by the application; (4) A5's TLP fires one probe at `max(2·SRTT, min_rto_us)` with the RFC 8985 `+max_ack_delay` penalty on FlightSize=1, all hard-coded — order-entry latency budgets need per-conn tuning.

**Spec refs:** §4 (public API surface addition), §4.2 (event-queue contract), §9.1 (counters), §9.3 (events).

**Deliverables:**

- `InternalEvent::emitted_ts_ns` field on every event variant, sampled at push time inside the engine (not at drain in `resd_net_poll`). `resd_net_event_t::enqueued_ts_ns` semantic tightens from "drain time" to "emission time" — field name unchanged, doc comment updated. Eliminates ±poll-interval skew (up to tens of µs at realistic poll rates) on every event's apparent time.
- `EventQueue` soft cap + drop-oldest policy on overflow. New slow-path counters `obs.events_dropped` (count of events discarded from the front) and `obs.events_queue_high_water` (latched max observed depth). New engine config field `event_queue_soft_cap` (u32, default 4096, min 64). Preserves "don't silently accumulate" without introducing head-of-line blocking on the producer side.
- New extern "C" function `resd_net_conn_stats(engine, conn, out) → i32` returning 9 `u32` fields: send-path (`snd_una`, `snd_nxt`, `snd_wnd`, `send_buf_bytes_pending`, `send_buf_bytes_free`) + RTT estimator (`srtt_us`, `rttvar_us`, `min_rtt_us`, `rto_us`). Enables per-order forensics tagging: "bytes in flight + current RTT + current RTO at send time." Slow-path; safe per-order, not per-segment. Pure projection — all fields already exist on `TcpConn` after A5 (send-path since A3; RTT fields from `rtt_est` and `rack.min_rtt`).
- Per-connection TLP tuning knobs (wire behavior; per-connect opt-in with defaults preserving RFC 8985). Five new `resd_net_connect_opts_t` fields: `tlp_pto_min_floor_us` (default inherits `tcp_min_rto_us`, range 0 .. `tcp_max_rto_us`), `tlp_pto_srtt_multiplier_x100` (default 200 = 2.0×, range 100..200 integer), `tlp_skip_flight_size_gate` (default false), `tlp_max_consecutive_probes` (default 1, range 1..5), `tlp_skip_rtt_sample_gate` (default false). Extends `tcp_tlp::pto_us` from fixed formula to `(srtt, &TlpConfig, flight_size) → u32`. Engine's TLP scheduler tracks a per-conn consecutive-probe counter that resets on every new RTT sample / newly-ACKed data. New slow-path counter `tcp.tx_tlp_spurious` incremented when DSACK confirms a prior TLP probe was unnecessary (attribution per probe via a fixed 5-entry ring on `TcpConn` with a 4·SRTT plausibility window). Spurious-ratio (`tx_tlp_spurious / tx_tlp`) is the app-side self-tuning signal — documented in A12's `13-order-entry-telemetry`.
- New `obs` counter group in `counters.rs` for engine-internal observability signals.
- Integration tests on TAP pair: emission-time correctness, overflow behavior (including that drained events are the most-recent, not the oldest), send-state getter under backpressure, `-ENOENT` on stale handle.

**Does NOT include:**
- Wire-behavior changes beyond the per-connect TLP tuning knobs listed above. Retransmit mechanics, RACK detect-lost rules, RTO formulas, congestion response, reassembly, and all other paths stay as A5 ships them.
- Event-queue-overflow events (i.e., emitting a new event on overflow) — per `feedback_observability_primitives_only.md` the counter + high-water pair is sufficient; app polls counters.
- `events_pending` live-depth gauge — intentionally deferred; revisit if A8 counter-coverage audit shows it's wanted.
- Persistent/ring-buffered event log — app owns persistence. A5.5 just keeps the in-engine FIFO honest.
- Changes to `rx_hw_ts_ns` semantics (owned by A-HW).
- WRITABLE event / timer API (owned by A6).

**Dependencies:** A5 (extends A5's event producers + `tcp_tlp.rs` + `rtt_est` + `rack.min_rtt`). **Independent of A-HW** — no shared files; can run in parallel.

**Ship gate:** `phase-a5-5-complete` tag requires (a) all integration tests green, (b) mTCP review report landed (expected no ADs for observability; TLP knobs flagged as scope-difference since mTCP does not implement TLP), (c) RFC compliance review landed (expected PASS-WITH-DEVIATIONS since the TLP knobs open 5 new §6.4 rows — all per-connect opt-in with defaults matching RFC 8985).

**Rough scale:** ~10–12 tasks. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-stage1-phase-a5-5-event-log-forensics-design.md` §9.

## A-HW — ENA hardware offload enablement

**Numbering note:** Inserted between A5 and A6 after the Stage 1 deployment environment was pinned down as AWS ENA on AMD EPYC Milan (spec §8.1–§8.5). Uses the non-numeric "A-HW" tag rather than renumbering A6–A12 because existing per-phase plan files (notably the in-progress A4 plan) already reference A5 / A6 / A8 / A10 by number.

**Goal:** Flip the port configuration from Phase A1's zeroed `rte_eth_conf` to the Stage 1 production-shape offload set: verify LLQ is active, enable TX+RX IPv4/TCP/UDP checksum offload, enable `MBUF_FAST_FREE`, and wire `RSS_HASH` plumbing (even on single-queue deployments) so the flow table can consume it once multi-queue lands. **Every offload is gated by a compile-time cargo feature flag** so that A10's benchmark harness can produce an on-vs-off A/B comparison per offload via rebuilds. Capability-gate every offload at runtime as well so `net_vdev` / `net_tap` test harnesses degrade to the software path even when the feature is compiled in.

**Spec refs:** §8.1–§8.5, §7.5 (dynfield lookup + inline accessor wired here), §9.2 (`rx_hw_ts_ns` plumbed end-to-end; stays 0 on ENA since ENA doesn't register the dynfield, but the code path is exercised and future-hardware-ready on mlx5 / newer-gen ENA), §11.1 (measurement-discipline preconditions reference offloads), §11.3 (TSC-only attribution fallback).

**Deliverables:**

- **Compile-time feature gates** in `crates/resd-net-core/Cargo.toml` — one per Tier 1 offload, all on by default:

  | Feature flag | Default | Gates |
  |---|---|---|
  | `hw-offload-llq` | ON | Passes `enable_llq=1` to the ENA PMD devargs; with the feature off, passes `enable_llq=0` so LLQ is explicitly disabled |
  | `hw-offload-tx-cksum` | ON | TX IPv4+TCP+UDP checksum offload bits + pseudo-header-only checksum in `tcp_output.rs` / `l3_ip.rs`; with feature off, software full-fold stays on the TX path |
  | `hw-offload-rx-cksum` | ON | RX IPv4+TCP+UDP checksum offload bits + `mbuf.ol_flags` inspection in `tcp_input.rs` / `l3_ip.rs`; with feature off, software verify runs on the RX path |
  | `hw-offload-mbuf-fast-free` | ON | `RTE_ETH_TX_OFFLOAD_MBUF_FAST_FREE` bit in `txmode.offloads` |
  | `hw-offload-rss-hash` | ON | `RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_RSS_HASH` bit + `rss_conf` setup + `mbuf.hash.rss` consumption in `flow_table.rs` (SipHash fallback when feature off) |
  | `hw-offload-rx-timestamp` | ON | `rte_mbuf_dynfield_lookup("rte_dynfield_timestamp")` + `rte_mbuf_dynflag_lookup("rte_dynflag_rx_timestamp")` at `engine_create`; inline RX accessor populates `event.rx_hw_ts_ns`; with feature off (or dynfield absent), accessor folds to constant 0, events carry 0, and callers fall back to `enqueued_ts_ns` per §7.5 |

  `[features]` table adds these as leaf features plus a convenience `hw-offloads-all` meta-feature that pulls in every `hw-offload-*` flag for explicit override. `default = [...all hw-offload-* flags...]`. Rebuilds with `--no-default-features --features hw-offloads-all` / `hw-offload-tx-cksum` / `<none>` / individual combinations are what A10's benchmark harness consumes to produce the A/B comparison.

  Each feature gate is placed at the **code site**, not the struct field, so the C ABI is unchanged across feature sets (same pattern as §9.1.1 for observability flags). A feature-off build compiles away the offload code path entirely; the binary is strictly smaller and does not execute any offload-path instructions.

- `engine.rs` port config upgraded:
  - Query `rte_eth_dev_info_get`; log one-line banner of `rx_offload_capa` / `tx_offload_capa` / `dev_flags`.
  - For each offload that is compile-time enabled, AND the requested bit against `dev_info.*_offload_capa`; WARN + one-shot counter per requested-but-unadvertised capability (`eth.offload_missing_<name>`); software path stays reachable (runtime capability gate per §8.5).
  - Populate `rte_eth_conf.rxmode.offloads` / `txmode.offloads` with bits that are both compile-time enabled AND runtime advertised.
  - When `hw-offload-rss-hash` is on: populate `rte_eth_conf.rx_adv_conf.rss_conf = { rss_hf: RTE_ETH_RSS_NONFRAG_IPV4_TCP | RTE_ETH_RSS_NONFRAG_IPV6_TCP, rss_key: NULL }` (NULL key → PMD default Toeplitz key); on single queue, program the RSS indirection table so every hash lands on queue 0.
- LLQ verification (when `hw-offload-llq` on): parse PMD startup log + read `dev_info.default_rxportconf` / `default_txportconf` signals; fail-hard if the device advertises LLQ capability but LLQ did not activate at bring-up.
- `tcp_output.rs` / `l3_ip.rs` TX checksum split, compile-gated by `hw-offload-tx-cksum`:
  - Feature ON: set `mbuf.ol_flags |= RTE_MBUF_F_TX_IPV4 | RTE_MBUF_F_TX_IP_CKSUM | RTE_MBUF_F_TX_TCP_CKSUM` (and UDP analog); set `mbuf.l2_len = 14`, `mbuf.l3_len = 20`, `mbuf.l4_len = tcp_hdr_len`; write **only** the TCP / UDP pseudo-header checksum per RFC 9293 §3.1. Runtime-fallback branch (if the PMD didn't advertise the capability) reverts to full-fold for that engine instance only.
  - Feature OFF: software full-fold on the TX path; no offload bits set.
- `tcp_input.rs` / `l3_ip.rs` RX checksum consumption, compile-gated by `hw-offload-rx-cksum`:
  - Feature ON: inspect `mbuf.ol_flags & RTE_MBUF_F_RX_IP_CKSUM_MASK` / `RTE_MBUF_F_RX_L4_CKSUM_MASK`; `GOOD` → verified, `BAD` → drop with counter, `NONE` / `UNKNOWN` → fall back to software fold.
  - Feature OFF: software verify runs unconditionally on the RX path.
- RSS-hash plumbing in `flow_table.rs`, compile-gated by `hw-offload-rss-hash`:
  - Feature ON: read `mbuf.hash.rss` as the initial 4-tuple hash when `RTE_MBUF_F_RX_RSS_HASH` is set; fall back to SipHash otherwise.
  - Feature OFF: always compute SipHash locally.
- NIC RX timestamp plumbing in `engine.rs` + event-emission sites, compile-gated by `hw-offload-rx-timestamp`:
  - Feature ON: at `engine_create`, call `rte_mbuf_dynfield_lookup("rte_dynfield_timestamp")` → store `ts_offset: Option<i32>` on engine state; call `rte_mbuf_dynflag_lookup("rte_dynflag_rx_timestamp")` → store `ts_flag_mask: Option<u64>`. Provide an always-inline accessor `hw_rx_ts_ns(mbuf) -> u64` that returns `*(uint64_t*)((char*)mbuf + ts_offset)` when **both** lookups succeeded **and** `mbuf.ol_flags & ts_flag_mask != 0`; returns 0 otherwise. RX paths that currently hardcode `rx_hw_ts_ns: 0` (`crates/resd-net-core/src/engine.rs:725`, `:995`; `crates/resd-net/src/lib.rs:161`, `:172`, `:185`) read the accessor from the originating mbuf instead. A3/A4 emission sites that have already dropped their source mbuf reference get the timestamp threaded through the internal event struct at the RX-decode boundary.
  - Feature OFF: accessor is `const fn hw_rx_ts_ns(_mbuf) -> u64 { 0 }`; no dynfield lookup at startup; all `rx_hw_ts_ns` fields stay 0.
  - On ENA (Stage 1 reference target): both dynfield and dynflag lookups return negative; accessor always yields 0; `rx_hw_ts_ns = 0` in every event as §8.3 / §9.2 already document. Callers use `enqueued_ts_ns` per §7.5. This is the exercised path in the Stage 1 smoke tests — the positive path is reachable but not asserted until a host with the dynfield is available (Stage 2 hardening).
- Counter additions (all slow-path per §9.1.1 — fire on bring-up + on `BAD` checksum only; fields always allocated for C-ABI stability even when the feature is off):
  - `eth.offload_missing_rx_cksum_ipv4`, `eth.offload_missing_rx_cksum_tcp`, `eth.offload_missing_rx_cksum_udp`, `eth.offload_missing_tx_cksum_ipv4`, `eth.offload_missing_tx_cksum_tcp`, `eth.offload_missing_tx_cksum_udp`, `eth.offload_missing_mbuf_fast_free`, `eth.offload_missing_rss_hash`, `eth.offload_missing_llq` — one-shot counters incremented once at `engine_create` per capability that was compile-time-enabled + runtime-requested but not advertised by the PMD. All zero in the reference ENA deployment; non-zero exposes a test-harness bring-up or a hardware change.
  - `eth.offload_missing_rx_timestamp` — one-shot counter incremented once at `engine_create` when `hw-offload-rx-timestamp` was compile-time-enabled but `rte_mbuf_dynfield_lookup` / `rte_mbuf_dynflag_lookup` returned negative. **Expected 1 on ENA** (dynfield not registered) — unlike the other `offload_missing_*` counters, this one being nonzero is the documented steady state for the Stage 1 target host, not an anomaly. 0 on hardware/PMDs that expose the dynfield (mlx5, ice on supporting NICs, future ENA generations).
  - `eth.rx_drop_cksum_bad` — drop count for segments where NIC reported `BAD` for IP or L4 checksum. Fires only on actual bad packets, not on offload misses.
- Software-fallback smoke test: build with default features AND run on `net_vdev` / `net_tap` where offloads are unavailable; assert the `offload_missing_*` counters are set as expected (including `offload_missing_rx_timestamp`) and that the runtime-fallback software checksum path correctly computes IP/TCP/UDP checksums end-to-end via the A3 TAP-pair harness; additionally assert every event's `rx_hw_ts_ns == 0` (dynfield-absent path). Second smoke run with `--no-default-features` asserts the compile-time-gated-off build also passes the same correctness harness (no offload path compiled in, pure software, `rx_hw_ts_ns = 0` by construction).
- Hardware-path smoke test: build with default features; bring the engine up on the actual ENA VF; log the negotiated offload banner; drive one full request-response cycle; assert all `offload_missing_*` counters are zero **except** `offload_missing_rx_timestamp == 1` (documented ENA steady state — the dynfield-absent path is the expected Stage 1 ground truth, not a failure); assert `eth.rx_drop_cksum_bad` is zero on well-formed traffic; assert every event's `rx_hw_ts_ns == 0`.
- **Measurement of actual offload benefit is deferred to A10** — A10's `tools/bench-offload-ab/` (added to A10's deliverables) will rebuild with each feature-flag combination and produce the p50/p99/p999 comparison that drives the final "keep/remove per offload" decision. A-HW's job is to make the code path switchable at compile time and correct under both settings; A10's job is to measure.

**Does NOT include:**
- Multi-queue enablement (Stage 1 single-queue per §12 — RSS indirection-table reprogramming for multiple queues is deferred, though the hash machinery is wired).
- Header/data split, TSO, GRO, GSO (explicitly excluded per §8.4 Tier 3).
- Any hot-path counter tracking "offload used" vs "software path" (startup log is authoritative per §8.5 / §9.1.1).
- Multi-segment RX/TX general enablement (A5's retransmit header-chained-to-data mbuf pattern keeps `MULTI_SEGS` enabled on TX, but the RX scatter offload stays off at MTU 1500).
- Validation of the HW-timestamp **positive** path on a PMD that actually registers `rte_dynfield_timestamp` (mlx5 / ice / future-gen ENA). The wiring is correct by construction + reviewed against the DPDK dynfield API, but end-to-end assertion on real timestamps is deferred to Stage 2 hardening when a target host with the dynfield is available. Stage 1 correctness gate is that the ENA dynfield-absent path works and `rx_hw_ts_ns = 0` propagates cleanly.

**Dependencies:** A5 (retransmit path goes through the same `tcp_output.rs` checksum branch; doing A-HW before A5 would require two visits to that file).

**Ship gate:** phase-a-hw-complete tag requires (a) software-fallback smoke tests green with both `--default-features` (runtime-fallback path exercised) and `--no-default-features` (compile-gated-off path exercised), (b) hardware-path smoke test green on the ENA VF with default features, (c) CI matrix builds every per-offload feature combination (or a sampled subset documented in the report) to prevent bit-rot of the feature-off branches. Final kept-vs-removed decision per offload is **not** gated here — it's gated in A10 once the A/B benchmark data exists.

**Rough scale:** ~14 tasks (port-config upgrade, LLQ verify, TX checksum feature gate + branch, RX checksum feature gate + branch, RSS-hash feature gate + flow-table read, MBUF_FAST_FREE feature gate, LLQ feature gate, RX-timestamp feature gate + dynfield/dynflag lookup at `engine_create`, RX-timestamp inline accessor + threading through A3/A4 event-emission sites, capability-gated runtime fallback paths, software-fallback smoke × 2 build configs, hardware-path smoke, counter additions + coverage entries, startup-banner format + CI feature-matrix build).

## A6 — Public API surface completeness

**Goal:** Finalize the public C ABI per §4: `resd_net_flush` actually flushes, `WRITABLE` events on send-buffer drain, timer API (`timer_add`/`cancel` + `TIMER` event), `resd_net_close(flags)` with `FORCE_TW_SKIP` + RFC 6191 guard, poll event-overflow queueing, mempool exhaustion error paths, `preset=rfc_compliance` runtime switch.

**Spec refs:** §4, §4.2 contracts, §6.5 TIME_WAIT shortening, §7.4 timer wheel + per-conn timer list + tombstone cancel, §9.3 error events.

**Deliverables:**
- Timer wheel implemented (hashed, 8 levels × 256 buckets, 10µs resolution).
- Per-conn timer list for O(k) cancel on close.
- `resd_net_timer_add` / `resd_net_timer_cancel` / `TIMER` event plumbed through.
- `resd_net_flush` drains TX batch via exactly one `rte_eth_tx_burst`.
- Send-buffer backpressure: `resd_net_send` returns partial; `RESD_NET_EVT_WRITABLE` on drain.
- `resd_net_close` accepts flags bitmask; `FORCE_TW_SKIP` honored only under RFC 6191 §4.2 conditions, otherwise emits `RESD_NET_EVT_ERROR{err=EPERM_TW_REQUIRED}`.
- Engine event queue with FIFO overflow semantics documented in §4.2.
- `preset` field on `engine_config` switches defaults (nagle on, delayed-ACK on, min_rto=200, initial_rto=1000, cc_mode=reno).
- Integration tests for each API contract edge case.

**Does NOT include:** test suite harnesses (those are A7/A8/A9).

**Dependencies:** A5.

**Rough scale:** ~20 tasks.

---

## A7 — Loopback test server + packetdrill-shim

**Goal:** Server-mode cargo feature `test-server` (accept on listening port, byte-stream echo). Luna-pattern packetdrill-shim that links `libresd_net` + socket-shim wrapper and runs curated packetdrill scripts.

**Spec refs:** §10.2, §10.12, §11 test-only loopback server is in scope.

**Deliverables:**
- `resd-net-testserver` crate behind feature flag `test-server`: implements `LISTEN` / `SYN-RECEIVED` / `ESTABLISHED` server path + byte-stream echo.
- `tools/packetdrill-shim/` — links `libresd_net.a`, redirects packetdrill's TUN read/write to stack rx/tx hooks, implements synchronous socket-shim wrapper for `connect`/`write`/`read`/`close`.
- `tools/packetdrill-shim/SKIPPED.md` enumerates untranslatable scripts (anything using `SIGIO`, `FIONREAD`, `SO_RCVLOWAT`, `MSG_PEEK`, delayed-ACK timing).
- Vendored or forked packetdrill in `third_party/packetdrill/`.
- CI job that runs the runnable subset of ligurio + shivansh + google/packetdrill corpora.
- Pass rate target: 100% on runnable TCP FSM scripts.

**Does NOT include:** tcpreq (A8), TCP-Fuzz (A9).

**Dependencies:** A6 (needs full API surface).

**Rough scale:** ~15 tasks (+ vendoring effort).

---

## A8 — tcpreq + observability gate

**Goal:** RFC 793bis MUST/SHOULD checklist via tcpreq, pointed at the loopback test server. Exact-counter observability smoke test as the Stage 1 gate.

**Spec refs:** §10.3, §10.10 Stage 1 ship criteria.

**Deliverables:**
- `tools/tcpreq-runner/` — wraps tcpreq against the loopback test server, parses output, emits a pass/fail table aligned to RFC 9293 requirement IDs.
- CI job that runs tcpreq MUST rules and fails on any deviation.
- Observability smoke test: a controlled scenario (N retransmits, M state transitions, K sends) asserts exact counter values and event order/count.
- **Counter-coverage audit** (catches declared-but-never-incremented fields; honours spec §9.1.1 counter-addition policy):
  - Static check: parse every `AtomicU64` field in `EthCounters` / `IpCounters` / `TcpCounters` / `PollCounters` and every `fetch_add` / `inc` / `add` call site; fail if any declared field has zero write sites in the crate.
  - **Explicit-deferred whitelist**: counters intentionally reserved for a later phase (currently `tx_retrans` / `tx_rto` / `tx_tlp` / `conn_rst` / `rx_out_of_order` — see `deferred_tcp_counters_zero_at_construction` in `counters.rs`) live in `tests/deferred-counters.txt` with a spec citation; static check ignores them.
  - **Feature-gated counters**: per §9.1.1, hot-path counters may live behind a cargo feature flag (default off). The audit runs twice — once with `--no-default-features` and once with `--all-features` — and each declared counter must be reachable in at least one of the two runs. Feature-gated counters outside the default build must be listed in `tests/feature-gated-counters.txt` with the flag name.
  - Dynamic check: for every counter, the test suite must include at least one scenario that drives it nonzero. Implemented as a table of (counter_name, scenario_fn) with a test that runs each scenario on a fresh engine and asserts the named counter ended > 0. Missing entries fail the audit.
  - `state_trans[from][to]`: every transition edge listed in spec §6.1 FSM must have a scenario that exercises it; unreachable edges are listed in an expected-unused file with a justification, reviewed at each phase sign-off.

**Dependencies:** A7.

**Rough scale:** ~10 tasks (+2 for the counter-coverage audit: static-check script + dynamic-scenario table).

---

## A9 — TCP-Fuzz differential + smoltcp FaultInjector

**Goal:** Differential fuzzing vs Linux TCP (in RFC-compliance-preset mode). Port smoltcp's `FaultInjector` pattern as a stackable RX middleware for local soak testing.

**Spec refs:** §10.5, §10.6.

**Deliverables:**
- `tools/tcp-fuzz-differential/` — TCP-Fuzz driver configured to run `libresd_net` in `preset=rfc_compliance` against Linux TCP as oracle.
- Regression-fuzz track: same inputs compared across `resd_net` releases.
- CI smoke run per merge; 72h continuous run on a dedicated box per stage cut.
- `FaultInjector` RX middleware — random drop/duplicate/reorder/corrupt with configurable rates, enabled via env var.
- Property tests (proptest) for TCP options encode/decode and reassembly invariants.
- cargo-fuzz targets: `tcp_input` with random pre-established state; IP/TCP header parser.
- Scapy-based adversarial test corpus for overlapping segments, malformed options, timestamp wraparound.

**Dependencies:** A6.

**Rough scale:** ~15 tasks.

---

## A10 — Benchmark harness (micro + e2e + stress + comparators)

**Goal:** Implement the §11 benchmark plan: microbenchmarks with order-of-magnitude targets, end-to-end RTT with HW-timestamp attribution, stability benchmarks under netem, comparative vs Linux in RFC-compliance preset, comparative vs mTCP on the burst-edge / long-connection workload. CI per-commit regression tracking.

**Spec refs:** §11 entire (§11.5.1 added for the mTCP comparator).

**Deliverables:**
- `tools/bench-micro/` — cargo-criterion harness for poll-empty, TSC read (FFI + inline), flow lookup hot/cold, `tcp_input` in/out-of-order, `send` small/chain, timer add/cancel, counters read.
- `tools/bench-e2e/` — request/response RTT harness with HW-timestamp attribution buckets and per-measurement sum-identity assertion.
- `tools/bench-stress/` — netem + FaultInjector scenario runner for §11.4 matrix.
- `tools/bench-vs-linux/` — dual-stack comparison vs Linux TCP with tap-jitter baseline subtraction.
- `tools/bench-offload-ab/` — per-offload A/B harness that consumes A-HW's `hw-offload-*` cargo feature flags (`hw-offload-llq`, `hw-offload-tx-cksum`, `hw-offload-rx-cksum`, `hw-offload-mbuf-fast-free`, `hw-offload-rss-hash`) by rebuilding the engine once per feature-combination and running a 128 B / 128 B request-response micro-workload on the ENA target host.
  - Config matrix: `baseline` (no features), per-offload-only (one feature each), `full` (all default features). Additional compositions optional if any single-offload result is ambiguous.
  - Workload: ≥ 10 000 round-trips per config post-warmup (drop first 1 000); fresh engine bring-up between configs with `rte_eal_cleanup`; same RNG seed across runs.
  - Measurement discipline: same preconditions as §11.1 (isolcpus, governor, C-states, TSC invariant, no thermal throttle during the run). Harness fails-fast on any precondition miss.
  - Report: p50 / p99 / p999 per config with bootstrap 95% CI; per-offload `delta_p99 = p99_baseline − p99_with_offload`; pass/fail per offload against the decision rule (`delta_p99 > 3 × noise_floor`, where noise_floor = p99 of two back-to-back baseline runs).
  - Report artifact: `docs/superpowers/reports/offload-ab.md` — CSV + decision table + rationale for any offload kept without signal (e.g. correctness defense-in-depth for `hw-offload-mbuf-fast-free`). Drives the final committed default feature set in `Cargo.toml`.
  - Sanity invariant: `full` config p99 not worse than the best individual-offload p99 (offloads compose). A violation blocks the A10 sign-off pending investigation.
- `tools/bench-vs-mtcp/` — dual-stack comparison vs mTCP, two sub-workloads:
  - `burst` (spec §11.5.1): K × G grid = 20 buckets. Burst size K ∈ {64 KiB, 256 KiB, 1 MiB, 4 MiB, 16 MiB}; idle gap G ∈ {0 ms, 1 ms, 10 ms, 100 ms}. Measurement: `t0` = inline TSC pre-send; `t1` = NIC HW TX timestamp on last segment of burst; per-burst throughput = K / (t1 − t0); aggregate p50/p99/p999 across ≥10k bursts/bucket. Secondary decomposition into initiation (spin-up) vs steady-state.
  - `maxtp` (spec §11.5.2): W × C grid = 28 buckets. Write size W ∈ {64 B, 256 B, 1 KiB, 4 KiB, 16 KiB, 64 KiB, 256 KiB}; connection count C ∈ {1, 4, 16, 64}. 60 s sustained pump per bucket post-warmup. Metrics: goodput (bytes/sec) and packet rate (pps) per (W, C).
  - Shared: kernel-side TCP sink as peer (reuses `bench-vs-linux` peer); `cc_mode=off`; pre-run checks (receive window, NIC headroom ≤70%, measurement-discipline); sanity invariants on TX-byte counters. mTCP built from `third_party/mtcp/` (already submoduled for the §10.13 review gate). CSV schema matches `bench-vs-linux` so `bench-report` handles all three.
- `tools/bench-report/` — CSV → dashboard feed.
- CI: cargo-criterion per commit with 5% regression gate; nightly e2e on dedicated host (includes `bench-vs-mtcp`).
- Measurement-discipline precondition check script: `isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, governor, TSC invariant, thermal-throttle detection.

**Dependencies:** A6 (full API needed for meaningful e2e), A9 (FaultInjector used by bench-stress), A-HW (offloads must be enabled so benchmarks measure the production-shape hot path, not the Phase A1 zeroed-`eth_conf` path). `third_party/mtcp` already present from the A2 review-gate setup — no new submodule work.

**Rough scale:** ~21 tasks (+6 for the mTCP comparator: build integration, peer wiring, `burst` grid runner, `maxtp` grid runner, measurement-contract harness with HW TX timestamps + TSC, result/CSV plumbing; +5 for `bench-offload-ab`: feature-matrix rebuild driver, fresh-engine run loop, percentile + CI computation, per-offload decision-rule evaluator, report writer).

---

## A11 — Stage 1 ship gate verification

**Goal:** Run every Stage 1 gate from spec §10.10 and §11.9. Publish the results as the Stage 1 ship artifact.

**Spec refs:** §10.10, §11.9.

**Deliverables:**
- Documented pass matrix: Layer A unit tests (100%), Layer B packetdrill runnable subset (100%), Layer C tcpreq MUST rules (100%), observability smoke, e2e smoke against chosen test peer (§13 nice-to-have resolved), §11 microbench targets met, §11.3 e2e p999 within documented bound of HW RTT, §11.4 stress matrix all green.
- `docs/superpowers/reports/stage1-ship-report.md` — signed off with commit SHAs and host/NIC/DPDK versions.

**Does NOT include:** the `stage-1-ship` git tag — that moves to A12 after documentation lands.

**Dependencies:** A1–A10 all complete.

**Rough scale:** ~5 tasks (mostly verification + reporting).

---

## A12 — Documentation (user + maintainer + future-work) + Stage 1 release tag

**Goal:** Ship `libresd_net` with structured documentation sufficient for (a) users to integrate and operate, (b) future maintainers to extend and fix, and (c) a durable record of considered-but-deferred work. Each audience gets its own directory tree under `docs/` with one focused markdown file per topic, linked from a directory-level index. Places the `stage-1-ship` tag at the end of this phase.

**Spec refs:** §2.1 (stage scoping), §3 (threading), §4 (public API), §5–§9 (internals), §10 (testing), §11 (benchmarks), §12 (out of scope), §13 (open questions).

**Documentation tree:**

Complements 09-counters (dictionary) and 10-events (dictionary) with end-to-end recipes. Sections: (a) per-order telemetry pattern — pre-send + on-ACK stats snapshot, `snd_nxt` / `snd_wnd` / `send_buf_bytes_pending` / `srtt_us` / `rttvar_us` / `min_rtt_us` / `rto_us` tagging, event-log capture; (b) congestion-episode reconstruction — the six canonical patterns (`rx_zero_window↑` = peer/exchange slow, `send_buf_full↑` + partial send = our buffer saturating, `tx_rto↑` / `tx_rack_loss↑` (A5) = path loss, `rx_dup_ack↑` + high `rx_sack_blocks` = reorder not loss, `conn_timeout_retrans↑` = session dying, `tx_zero_window↑` + `recv_buf_drops↑` = our consumer slow), each with a concrete counter+event trace, a companion `stats()`-snapshot trace showing SRTT/RTTVAR/min_RTT trajectories, and the "what to do about it" action (reconnect, parallel connection, `rack_aggressive=true`, app-side pacing); (c) leading vs lagging indicators — `srtt_us` rise and `rttvar_us` spike often precede `send_buf_full` or `rx_zero_window` crossing into pathological territory, so apps can trigger mitigation earlier by watching RTT ratios (`srtt_us / min_rtt_us`) alongside counters; (d) aggressive-retry strategies the library's primitives enable but do not implement (parallel sockets, duplicate-clOrdID across connections, A5's `rto_no_backoff`, A5.5's per-connect TLP knobs `tlp_pto_min_floor_us=0` / `tlp_pto_srtt_multiplier_x100=100` / `tlp_skip_flight_size_gate=true` / `tlp_max_consecutive_probes≤5` / `tlp_skip_rtt_sample_gate=true`), with explicit notes on where stack ends and app orchestration begins; (e) the `obs.events_dropped` / `obs.events_queue_high_water` signal (A5.5) and what it means when nonzero during an episode; (f) **TLP self-tuning recipe** — app tracks `tcp.tx_tlp_spurious / tcp.tx_tlp` across a rolling window; ratio above ~3–5% means the aggressive PTO floor is firing probes before peer ACKs realistically arrive, so the app raises `tlp_pto_min_floor_us` on the offending socket (re-connect with new opts, since this is a connect-time knob). Targets a steady-state spurious rate under 5% while keeping the fastest PTO the path tolerates. Worked example from a simulated stall: raw counter-snapshot stream + per-conn `stats()` trajectory + event log reconstructed into a human-readable timeline.

**Per-directory conventions:**
- Each `README.md` is an index with a one-line summary per section + a "read these first if you're new" ordering.
- Numeric `NN-slug.md` prefixes give intentional reading order while staying grep-friendly; numbers jump by 1 so renames are cheap.
- Cross-links use relative paths (`../user-guide/04-configuration.md`) so the tree stays movable.
- Every page opens with an "Audience" line and a "Prerequisites" line pointing at earlier sections, so cold-start readers aren't lost.

**Deliverables — supporting:**
- `README.md` (repo root) refresh: one-paragraph positioning + pointers to the three index READMEs.
- `CHANGELOG.md` baseline entry for the Stage 1 release (references the tag).
- `scripts/audit-todos.sh` — regenerates `docs/future-work/06-codebase-todos.md` from `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX` markers so refreshes are deterministic; runs in CI and fails if the committed file is stale.
- **Tag:** `git tag -a stage-1-ship -m "Stage 1 ship"` at tip of this phase (moved here from A11).

**Does NOT include:** per-function docstrings (written in source as code lands); generated Rust API docs from `cargo doc` (already in CI); generated C header docs (cbindgen already annotates).

**Dependencies:** A11 complete (ship report is the source for several sections in `future-work/`).

**Rough scale:** ~13 tasks — 4 for the user-guide tree (index + 13 sections grouped into ~4 commits by theme: overview/build/lifecycle, config/threading/send-recv/close, errors/counters/events/limitations/troubleshooting, and a dedicated commit for 13-order-entry-telemetry given it pulls together counter + event + send-state material into a trading-specific forensics playbook with a worked example), 4 for the maintainer-guide tree (architecture+invariants, state+options+flow+timers+iss+mempool, ffi+tests+bench, reviews+debugging+conventions), 2 for the future-work tree (reviews-consolidation + remainder), 1 for the TODO-audit script, 1 for root README+CHANGELOG refresh, 1 for the tag.

## A13 — HTTP/1.1 + TLS client integration + bench (via `contek-io/cpp_common`)

**Parallelism note:** A13 and A14 are **independent of each other** and can (and should) run in parallel once A12 is complete. Whichever starts first lands the `Transport` abstraction in `contek-io/cpp_common` (see shared groundwork below); the other rebases onto it. Both phases depend on A12 (ship tag) but not on each other.

**Framing:** This phase does not add HTTP, TLS, or WebSocket to `libresd_net` — Stage 1 stays raw-TCP (spec §1 / §2.1). Instead, it validates that the Stage 1 byte-stream API is fit-for-purpose for a real HTTP/1.1 + TLS client that lives **outside** the stack, in the user's existing C++ library `contek-io/cpp_common`. `libresd_net` sees only the encrypted byte stream; TLS handshake + record layer + HTTP/1.1 parsing all happen inside `cpp_common` as today.

**Goal:** Prove the byte-stream API is enough for a real HTTP/1.1 + TLS client. Build `cpp_common`'s HTTP client on top of a new `resd_net`-backed transport; run integration tests against a TLS HTTP server; benchmark p50 / p99 / p999 latency against the same client on kernel TCP as the comparator baseline.

**Spec refs:** §4 (public byte-stream API), §5.3 (buffer ownership — application owns TLS buffering), §6.4 (trading defaults like Nagle off / delayed-ACK off apply cleanly to encrypted byte streams), §11 (benchmark plan — this extends it with an HTTP+TLS bucket).

**Upstream prerequisite (shared with A14 — whichever phase starts first lands this):**

- `contek-io/cpp_common` PR: add a `Transport` abstraction (C++ interface) with two concrete impls:
  - `KernelTransport` — existing behavior, wraps POSIX `::send` / `::recv` / epoll on a kernel socket.
  - `ResdNetTransport` — wraps `resd_net_connect` / `resd_net_send` / `resd_net_poll` (consumes `RESD_NET_EVT_READABLE` / `WRITABLE` / `CLOSED` / `ERROR`) behind the same `Transport` interface.
- Existing HTTP/1.1 and WebSocket clients in `cpp_common` are ported to consume the `Transport` interface rather than the POSIX socket API directly.
- TLS layer in `cpp_common` (OpenSSL or rustls-backed, whichever cpp_common uses today) is unchanged except that its BIO / read-callback-write-callback pair sits on top of `Transport` instead of a raw socket FD. Both transports look identical to the TLS code.
- cpp_common unit tests: `Transport` contract tests pass on both impls; end-to-end `GET https://<server>/echo` yields byte-identical responses on both.

The PR is reviewed and merged in `contek-io/cpp_common`'s own process; this repo's phase depends on the merge landing but the PR itself is tracked out-of-tree.

**Deliverables (this repo):**

- `tools/bench-http-tls/` — C++ harness that uses `cpp_common`'s HTTP/1.1 + TLS client configured with `ResdNetTransport`; drives a mixed request workload against a TLS HTTP server; measures end-to-end latency (`send_request` → `full_response_parsed`); writes CSV in the same schema as `tools/bench-vs-linux` so `tools/bench-report` (A10) handles it.
  - Workload mix (three independent sub-benches):
    1. `small-get`: 100 B request, 1 KB response, new connection per request — measures TLS handshake cost under the stack.
    2. `keep-alive-get`: same sizes but persistent connection, 10 000 sequential requests — measures steady-state request-response RTT.
    3. `post-body`: 4 KB request body, 200 response, keep-alive — measures TX chain + TLS write-path behavior.
  - Comparator runs: same harness, same server, `KernelTransport`. Reported per sub-bench as `resd_p99 − kernel_p99` (after the §11.1 measurement-discipline preconditions).
- `tools/bench-http-tls/SERVER.md` — documents the test server matrix:
  - Local CI server: `nginx` with a self-signed cert + TLS 1.3 enabled + `/echo`, `/small`, `/large` endpoints. Containerized so CI is reproducible. TLS cert pinning documented.
  - Release validation server: a real exchange REST testnet (venue TBD by the user; the doc enumerates which venues the cpp_common client already connects to today, and selects one for the published numbers).
- Integration test in `tests/` (cargo + cmake mixed crate): one end-to-end HTTP+TLS request/response exercising `resd_net_connect → send → poll → recv events → close`, asserting byte-identical response vs kernel transport.
- Results artifact: `docs/superpowers/reports/app-fit-http-tls.md` — CSV of p50 / p99 / p999 per sub-bench × per transport, delta vs kernel, plus a bug/gap section listing any issues found in `libresd_net` or `cpp_common` with links to the fix commits / upstream PRs.

**Does NOT include:**
- TLS, HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/2/3 implementations inside `libresd_net` — these stay in Stage 3 / Stage 4 (spec §2.1) and are explicitly out of Stage 1.
- Parsing HTTP inside the library (Stage 3).
- Server-side HTTP (spec §1 explicitly: no production server-side TCP).
- Benchmark-harness work that duplicates A10 — this reuses A10's measurement-discipline checker, CSV writer, and `bench-report` dashboard.

**Dependencies:** A12 (Stage 1 ship tag exists; documentation-level API contract frozen). **Not dependent on A14** — A13 and A14 run in parallel.

**Rough scale:** ~10 tasks (cpp_common `Transport` abstraction + upstream PR if not yet landed; cpp_common HTTP/1.1-on-Transport port; `bench-http-tls` harness + 3 sub-benches; test server setup + CI container; integration test; CSV writer wiring into `bench-report`; kernel-transport comparator run; p99-delta evaluator; report generator; any `libresd_net` bugfix cycles uncovered by the run).

## A14 — WebSocket + TLS client integration + bench (via `contek-io/cpp_common`)

**Parallelism note:** See A13 — A13 and A14 are independent of each other and run in parallel after A12. Shared `Transport` abstraction in `cpp_common` is a one-time groundwork landed by whichever phase starts first.

**Framing:** Mirror of A13 for the WebSocket + TLS client in `cpp_common`. Validates the byte-stream API under a long-lived, asymmetric-traffic (server-push) workload typical of market-data WebSocket feeds — a more demanding shape than HTTP/1.1 request-response, and the dominant real-world consumer of the stack in trading deployments.

**Goal:** Prove the byte-stream API is enough for a real WebSocket + TLS client under market-data-shaped traffic. Build `cpp_common`'s WS client on top of the `ResdNetTransport`; run integration tests against a TLS WS echo server; benchmark server-push latency and echo RTT against the kernel-transport baseline.

**Spec refs:** §4, §5.3, §6.4, §11.

**Upstream prerequisite (shared with A13):** Same `Transport` abstraction in `cpp_common` as A13 describes. The WS client is ported to consume `Transport`; TLS layer unchanged. If A13 landed the PR first, A14 rebases; if A14 lands first, A13 rebases. The upstream PR covers both clients together unless the phases are genuinely interleaved.

**Deliverables (this repo):**

- `tools/bench-ws-tls/` — C++ harness using `cpp_common`'s WS + TLS client on `ResdNetTransport`. Two independent sub-benches:
  1. `echo-rtt`: small (64 B) frames in a tight request → server echoes → measure RTT loop, 10 000 frames post-warmup. p50 / p99 / p999 RTT. Exercises the stack's per-segment TX/RX path under encrypted framing.
  2. `server-push`: connect, subscribe-pattern (configurable topic list), server pushes binary frames at sustained ~1 MB/s for 60 s with a realistic frame-size distribution (most 200 B, occasional 4 KB, rare 64 KB). Measure per-frame `server_push_send_ts → RESD_NET_EVT_READABLE delivered` latency. Drives the canonical market-data shape.
- `tools/bench-ws-tls/SERVER.md` — documents the test server matrix:
  - Local CI server: `websocketd` or a small purpose-built server wrapping an echo + configurable-push endpoint, with TLS 1.3 + self-signed cert. Containerized. Push-rate and frame-size distribution configurable per bench run.
  - Release validation: a real exchange WebSocket market-data testnet (venue TBD; document which venues cpp_common connects to today and pick one).
- Integration test: WS handshake → subscribe → receive N frames → close cleanly; asserts byte-identical frame payloads vs kernel-transport run.
- Frame-size coverage: small (64 B), medium (1 KB), large (64 KB) — exercises WS frame fragmentation in cpp_common and `libresd_net`'s single-mbuf vs mbuf-chain paths.
- Results artifact: `docs/superpowers/reports/app-fit-ws-tls.md` — CSV + percentile table per sub-bench × per transport, delta vs kernel, per-frame-size decomposition for the large end, plus bug/gap section. Same schema as A13's report so both can be consumed by a single dashboard.

**Does NOT include:**
- WebSocket implementation inside `libresd_net` (spec §2.1 Stage 5, and §12 explicitly for `permessage-deflate` — that stays permanently out of scope).
- Server-side WebSocket (spec §1 no production server-side).
- TLS implementation inside `libresd_net`.
- HTTP/1.1 handshake upgrade path — cpp_common owns the WS upgrade; this repo only sees the encrypted byte stream after upgrade.

**Dependencies:** A12. **Not dependent on A13** — A14 and A13 run in parallel.

**Rough scale:** ~10 tasks (cpp_common WS-on-Transport port — shared upstream PR with A13 if it hasn't landed; `bench-ws-tls` harness + 2 sub-benches; test server setup + CI container; integration test with frame-size coverage; CSV writer wiring; kernel-transport comparator; p99-delta evaluator; report generator; bugfix cycles for any issues uncovered).

## Cross-phase process notes

- Each per-phase plan file gets its date-prefixed name: `YYYY-MM-DD-stage1-phase-aN-<slug>.md`. Prefix with the date the plan is written, not the phase number.
- **Phase review gates** before the `phase-aN-complete` tag:
  1. **mTCP comparison review (A2 onward, spec §10.13)** — dispatch `mtcp-comparison-reviewer` (`.claude/agents/mtcp-comparison-reviewer.md`); subagent writes `docs/superpowers/reviews/phase-aN-mtcp-compare.md`; human edits Accepted-divergence + verdict. First phase to run the review (A2) added `third_party/mtcp` as a one-time submodule prerequisite.
  2. **RFC compliance review (A3 onward, spec §10.14)** — dispatch `rfc-compliance-reviewer` (`.claude/agents/rfc-compliance-reviewer.md`); subagent writes `docs/superpowers/reviews/phase-aN-rfc-compliance.md`; human edits Accepted-deviation + verdict. One-time prerequisite: `scripts/fetch-rfcs.sh` has already vendored RFC text under `docs/rfcs/`. A2 is exempt because this gate was added after A2 shipped; optionally run a retroactive A2 RFC review at A3 kickoff.

  The tag is blocked while either applicable report has any unresolved `[ ]` item in its Must-fix / Missed-edge-cases / Missing-SHOULD sections.
- After a phase ships, tag: `git tag -a phase-aN-complete -m "Phase AN: <title>"`.
- Update the "Status" column in this file when a phase starts (→ In progress) or ships (→ Complete, link the plan file if not already there).
- The spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-dpdk-tcp-design.md` is the single source of truth for what Stage 1 actually needs. If a phase reveals a spec gap or contradiction, amend the spec first (in a separate commit), then the plan.
