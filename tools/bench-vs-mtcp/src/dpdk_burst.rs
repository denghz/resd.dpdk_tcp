//! dpdk_net burst-workload runner — spec §11.1.
//!
//! Drives the K × G grid against a live kernel-TCP sink peer using one
//! persistent TCP connection (established once, reused for all
//! measurement bursts + warmup).
//!
//! # Measurement contract (spec §11.1)
//!
//! Per burst:
//! - `t0` = inline TSC read immediately before the first
//!   `engine.send_bytes(..)` of the burst.
//! - `t_first_wire` = NIC HW TX timestamp on segment 1 of the burst.
//!   On ENA, no TX-TS dynfield is advertised; fall back to the TSC
//!   captured right after the first `engine.send_bytes` call returns
//!   (which is the closest observable point to "segment 1 hit the
//!   NIC" that user-space gets without HW TS).
//! - `t1` = NIC HW TX timestamp on the last segment of the burst. On
//!   ENA, fall back to TSC captured at the end of the drain when
//!   `drain_tx_pending_data` has flushed the final segment through
//!   `rte_eth_tx_burst`.
//!
//! Throughput per burst = K / (t1 − t0), emitted in bps (bench-common's
//! summariser aggregates across ≥10 k bursts per bucket).
//!
//! # TX-TS availability
//!
//! ENA does not expose the `rte_mbuf::tx_timestamp` dynfield (confirmed
//! by the A-HW Task 18 offload-counter profile: `offload_missing_rx_
//! timestamp = 1` and the same hardware gap applies to TX). On
//! mlx5/ice and future-gen ENA, the HW TS dynfield will be available;
//! a future enhancement swaps the TSC fallback for the HW TS read.
//! `TxTsMode` below records which path was taken so CSV consumers can
//! filter out TSC-only rows when diffing against HW-TS rows on a
//! different NIC.
//!
//! # Warmup + sanity invariant
//!
//! `warmup` bursts are pumped without recording samples. After the
//! measurement bursts, the runner snapshots
//! `counters.tcp.tx_payload_bytes` and calls
//! [`crate::preflight::check_sanity_invariant`] against
//! `sum_over_bursts(K)`. Any divergence surfaces as `Err` — harness
//! is lying about what it sent.
//!
//! # Gap enforcement
//!
//! Between bursts, sleep for `G` milliseconds (`G = 0` → no sleep,
//! back-to-back). The sleep is `std::thread::sleep` — coarse enough
//! that the 1ms / 10ms / 100ms gaps are honored within a few µs on a
//! tuned host, and the 0ms gap is exactly zero (no syscall).
