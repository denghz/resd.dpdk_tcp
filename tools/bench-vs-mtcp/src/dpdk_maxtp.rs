//! dpdk_net max-sustained-throughput runner — spec §11.2.
//!
//! Drives the W × C grid against a live kernel-TCP sink peer. For
//! each bucket, opens `C` persistent connections (reused for the whole
//! bucket), pumps W-byte writes in a tight round-robin for T = 60 s
//! after a 10 s warmup, and reports sustained goodput + packet rate.
//!
//! # Measurement contract (spec §11.2)
//!
//! - Warmup: 10 s pumping, counters not snapshotted.
//! - Measurement window: 60 s post-warmup.
//! - Snapshots at `t_warmup_end` and `t_end` of:
//!   - `tcp.tx_payload_bytes` (when `obs-byte-counters` is on — default
//!     OFF, so the sanity invariant check is skipped when the counter
//!     stays at zero).
//!   - `eth.tx_pkts` as a proxy for "segments transmitted" — spec
//!     §11.2 calls for `segments_tx_counter_delta`. The nearest real
//!     counter in `dpdk-net-core` is `eth.tx_pkts` which includes
//!     TCP + ARP but the warmup-then-measure shape means the tiny
//!     constant ARP floor is overshadowed by the bucket's TX volume.
//!     (The spec mentions `dpdk_net_counters::tcp::tx_pkts` which does
//!     not exist in the crate today; `eth.tx_pkts` is the closest
//!     available — note the variance from the spec string here so the
//!     follow-up hook-up at T15 can expose the TCP-only variant if the
//!     ARP floor proves non-negligible.)
//!   - For ACKed bytes: the peer's running `snd_una` (per conn).
//!     `snd_una_total` across all conns at window close minus at
//!     warmup end = ACKed bytes in the window.
//!
//! # TX-TS mode
//!
//! Unlike burst, maxtp is a sustained-rate measurement — there's no
//! per-iteration HW TX-TS capture to do. The `TxTsMode` on the
//! cfg is propagated into CSV for schema uniformity with burst
//! (downstream bench-report filters by mode to avoid mixing HW-TS rows
//! with TSC-fallback rows). ENA stays on `TscFallback`.
//!
//! # Multi-connection pump loop
//!
//! For C > 1 we open `C` connections up-front and round-robin writes
//! across them in the inner hot loop:
//!
//! ```text
//! for iteration in 0.. {
//!     let conn = conns[iteration % conns.len()];
//!     engine.send_bytes(conn, &payload);
//!     engine.poll_once();   // amortised: once per outer round.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! We poll once per full round (after writing to each conn once), not
//! per write, so the batching shape matches burst (spec says "tight
//! loop"). The engine's flow table + poll loop are single-lcore —
//! multiple connections on the same lcore just increase the flow-table
//! working set; nothing prevents this.
