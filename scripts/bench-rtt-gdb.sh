# bench-rtt-gdb.sh — wrapper that runs /tmp/bench-rtt under gdb-batch and
# captures a stack trace on SIGSEGV. Used to diagnose silent exit-139
# crashes observed in repeated DPDK process invocations during a
# bench-nightly session (see docs/superpowers/reports/a10-ab-driver-debug-v2.md
# for the original investigation against the predecessor binary).
#
# Phase 12 of the 2026-05-09 bench-suite overhaul deleted the
# bench-ab-runner crate; this wrapper was repointed at /tmp/bench-rtt
# (the binary that bench-offload-ab / bench-obs-overhead now subprocess
# via --runner-bin) and renamed accordingly.
#
# stdout/stderr pass through to the parent (bench-offload-ab /
# bench-obs-overhead) so the runner's CSV harvest stays intact. gdb's
# own diagnostic + the post-crash backtrace land in
# /tmp/bench-rtt-gdb.log so they don't pollute the CSV stream.
