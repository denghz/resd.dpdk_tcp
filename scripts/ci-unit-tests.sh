# Workspace-wide unit + doc tests. Covers every member crate except the
# fuzz sub-project (which lives in crates/dpdk-net-core/fuzz and is
# excluded from the root workspace).
#
# Per-package loop for the unit-test pass (not `cargo test --workspace`):
# a workspace-wide invocation would activate `test-inject` (via
# scapy-fuzz-runner) and `test-server` (via tcpreq-runner) at once on
# dpdk-net-core through Cargo feature unification. The test-inject
# feature gates in a different `Engine::inject_rx_frame` variant that
# does not bump `eth.rx_pkts`, so the counter-coverage test
# `cover_eth_rx_pkts` fails under a unified build. Running each crate
# in its own invocation keeps each crate's feature set scoped to what
# its Cargo.toml actually requests — matching the plan's stated intent
# of "default features work across every workspace crate".
#
# Doc tests use a single workspace-wide `cargo test --workspace --doc`
# call because (a) workspace-doc-test silently skips crates without a lib
# target (ffi-test / scapy-fuzz-runner have no lib), and (b) doc tests
# in this repo don't touch the feature-gated inject_rx_frame paths that
# create the unification problem for the regular test pass.
#
# The feature-matrix stage (ci-feature-matrix.sh) covers the feature-space
# sweep for dpdk-net-core, so this stage's job is "the default build of
# each crate passes its tests".
#
# Placed before ci-feature-matrix.sh in the CI order so regressions that
# break the default-feature build of any workspace crate surface in
# minutes, before the tens of minutes the 8-build matrix takes.
