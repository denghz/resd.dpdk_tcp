# Static counter-coverage audit — verifies every name in
# ALL_COUNTER_NAMES has at least one increment site in the current
# cargo feature set, honoring the deferred + feature-gated whitelists.
#
# Usage: counter-coverage-static.sh [--no-default-features | --all-features]
# Invoked twice by ci-counter-coverage.sh; union of the two runs must
# cover every counter.
#
# Mutation patterns recognized (multi-line aware):
#   - <group>.<field>.fetch_add( ... )  / fetch_max / store
#   - counters::inc(&...<field>) / counters::add(&...<field>, ...)
#   - bare inc(&...<field>) / add(&...<field>, ...) after local `use`
#   - &<ref>.<field>[ , ) ] passed to a helper (e.g. and_offload_with_miss_counter)
#
# Chains may span multiple lines (ripgrep --multiline-dotall).
#
# Spec §3.3 + §5.1 rationale:
#   - Deferred counters live in tests/deferred-counters.txt (allowed to
#     be absent in all builds; documents declared-but-unwired fields).
#   - Feature-gated counters live in tests/feature-gated-counters.txt
#     (allowed absent in --no-default-features; required in --all-features).

  # Translate "tcp.rx_syn" → regex over the field name. Group prefix
  # (e.g., "tcp") does not appear in every call site (some functions
  # take &TcpCounters directly, so the local var is named `counters`
  # without `.tcp.`); field-name match is the reliable anchor.

  # Multi-line-aware pattern. Rust source uses four mutation shapes:
  #   (a) direct chain ending in fetch_add / fetch_max / store (possibly
  #       broken across lines: `counters\n    .eth\n    .offload_missing_llq\n
  #       .fetch_add(...)`)
  #   (b) inc(&<...>.field) or add(&<...>.field, ...) — with or without
  #       the `counters::` prefix (local `use crate::counters::{inc, add};`
  #       makes the bare form common)
  #   (c) &<...>.field passed as an argument — e.g.,
  #       and_offload_with_miss_counter(...,&counters.eth.offload_missing_rss_hash, ...)
  #   (d) Phase 11 (C-E2): split helper `inc_<field>` taking &TcpCounters —
  #       e.g., `inc_tx_retrans_rto(&counters.tcp)` bumps tx_retrans_rto
  #       (and the aggregate). Recognizes any helper named exactly
  #       `inc_<field>` so future similar split helpers don't need a script
  #       change.
