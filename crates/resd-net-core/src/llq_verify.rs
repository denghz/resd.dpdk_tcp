//! LLQ activation verification via PMD log-scrape (A-HW Task 12 / spec §5).
//!
//! Amazon ENA's Low-Latency Queue (LLQ) mode is an ENA-internal state with
//! no clean DPDK API to query post-`rte_eth_dev_start`. The PMD emits a
//! structured "Placement policy: <mode>" log line during `eth_ena_dev_init`
//! and, on failure paths, a "LLQ is not supported" / "Fallback to host mode
//! policy" diagnostic. We redirect the DPDK log stream to an in-memory
//! buffer for the duration of bring-up, then string-match the capture.
//!
//! Markers pinned against DPDK 23.11 (`drivers/net/ena/ena_ethdev.c`):
//!   - `PMD_DRV_LOG(INFO, "Placement policy: %s\n", ...)` where `%s` is
//!     literally `"Low latency"` on success and `"Regular"` on fallback
//!     (ena_ethdev.c:2273-2277).
//!   - `PMD_DRV_LOG(INFO, "LLQ is not supported. Fallback to host mode
//!     policy.\n")` on advertise-missing (ena_ethdev.c:2044-2045).
//!
//! Future DPDK upgrades that change these strings will fail engine startup
//! rather than silently running without LLQ — the fail-safe direction
//! required by parent §8.4 Tier 1 / A-HW spec §5.
//!
//! # Capture-timing correction (Task 12 fixup)
//!
//! The ENA "Placement policy" log line is printed during `eth_ena_dev_init`
//! — which runs at `rte_eal_init` / PCI bus-scan time, NOT during the
//! `rte_eth_dev_start` callback. Task 12's original implementation installed
//! the capture around `rte_eth_dev_start`, opening the capture window AFTER
//! the PMD had already emitted its markers. On real ENA hosts the captured
//! buffer was therefore empty and verification failed hard on every
//! bring-up. This fixup moves the capture into the Rust-side `eal_init`
//! helper so it wraps `rte_eal_init` (see `engine::eal_init`). The
//! capture-time log is scanned once for the activation / failure markers,
//! and the resulting `LlqVerdict` is stored in a process-global
//! `OnceLock`. `Engine::new` reads the stored verdict per-engine instead of
//! running its own capture — multiple engine creates on the same host
//! share one EAL-init verdict because EAL init happens once per process.
//!
//! Reference: `/tmp/dpdk/drivers/net/ena/ena_ethdev.c` — marker emission
//! at lines 2273-2277 (inside `ena_parse_devargs` → `eth_ena_dev_init`
//! → PCI probe, all under `rte_eal_init`). `ena_start` (called from
//! `rte_eth_dev_start`) emits no LLQ markers.
